# Module 5 Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler
Workday Scheduling is a system that comprehensively manages employees, businesses and personal needs when creating shift schedules. It was recommended by the UFC Bootcamp Elite to incorporate, as a future Web Dev Engineer, the skills needed to create current time planners with the ability to store user input for later.


* **User Story**: 
AS A Coding BootCamp Instructor
I WANT to add important lectures to current time scheduler
SO THAT I can manage time  

* **Acceptance Criteria**: 
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
